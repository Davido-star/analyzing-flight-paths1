# Lab4 Analyzing Flight Paths, David Smith.  
Python 3

Lab 4 has been a challenge! I accept. In general, this script reads information from two separate .dat files and uses this information to learn out the frequency of plane flights traveling a certain distance. Spoiler alert, most airline flights are around 1,000km – not too far, but too far to drive. The first coding challenge requires the printing of an airport in just one country but maybe 2, it was unclear, in my script I have printed the names of all the airports in The Gambia of which there is one. If you’ve never been, you’re missing out on tarmac beers and broken airplanes… The next coding challenge has us define new dictionaries. I had to work with Shashank on this one. I couldn’t figure out how to make each airport unique, Shashank helped me out with defining a new variable linked to the unique airport Id’s with the airport.dat file. Thank you, Shashank. Then in challenge 3 we calculated distance between flight paths. The defining of the distance function is all important for later on in the script. With this distance function, we can have the latitude and longitude of a source airport and find the distance to a destination airport- that’s hard. To complete the distance calculations between source airports and destination airports, we brought up a routes.dat file and put the source airports into one list and the destinations into another. Shashank helped me out here with the defining of new variables for each source longitude, latitude, and destination longitude, latitude. Once the longitudes and latitudes for the source and destinations were in their own list we could run the distance function created earlier to calculate the distances between each source and destination. Now, to visualize the calculations I used the tools numpy and matplotlib to draw up a histogram with the distances between flights on the x axis and number of flights on the y axis. This turned out really cool and I’m happy with having learned this! An example of the histogram created is attached bellow.
